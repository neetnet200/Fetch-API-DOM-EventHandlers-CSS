PokeAPI with HTML / CSS / JavaScript

🐱‍🚀 Fetch API interface allows web browser to make HTTP requests to web servers 

🐱‍🚀 HTML DOM allows JavaScript to react to HTML events 

🐱‍🚀 A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element

🐱‍🚀 Examples of HTML events:

*** When a user clicks the mouse
*** When a web page has loaded
*** When an image has been loaded
*** When the mouse moves over an element
*** When an input field is changed
*** When an HTML form is submitted
*** When a user strokes a key


🐱‍🚀 Events are signals fired inside the browser window that notify of changes in the browser or operating system environment. Programmers can create event handler code that will run when an event fires, allowing web pages to respond appropriately to change https://developer.mozilla.org/
